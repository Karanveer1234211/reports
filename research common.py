research_common.py - discipline shared by every research tool.

Four things live here so that no two tools can define them differently:

    TIMING CONTRACT   what is known when, checked against the data itself
    REGIME POSTERIOR  Gaussian-mixture assignment that never imputes
    LOCKBOX           the final period no research step may look at
    RESEARCH LEDGER   an append-only count of every experiment and every
                      lockbox look

THE PROBLEM THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR
==================================
The pipeline is now good at preventing classic lookahead - using tomorrow's
price. The larger risk has moved: RESEARCH-SELECTION LEAKAGE. Run a thousand
reasonable experiments, keep what survives, call it an edge. Nothing in any
single experiment is wrong; the selection across them is. The lockbox and
the ledger are the defence, and they only work if every tool uses the same
ones.
